# Simple-Evolutionary-Algorithm

This repository holds the code that implements the solution for the problem proposed by Goldberg [1]. I used a simple evolutionary algorithm consisting of:

 - Random initialization of the population
 - Fitness evaluation
 - Parent selection
 - One-point cross-over recombination
 - Mutation
 - Parent replacement
 
 The termination condition is based on a limited number of epochs.
 
 To run the algorithm:
 
    > javac Run.java
    > java Run
